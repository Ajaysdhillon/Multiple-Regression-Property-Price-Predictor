🏡 House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression
📌 Overview
This project develops a House Price Prediction Model using Multiple Linear Regression. It considers multiple features (both numerical and categorical) to estimate house prices accurately.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes various factors affecting house prices, such as:

Numerical Features: Area, Number of Bedrooms, Age of Property, etc.

Categorical Features: Location, Property Type, etc.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-Learn (Multiple Linear Regression, Preprocessing, Pipelines)

Feature Scaling & Encoding (StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder)

🏗️ Machine Learning Pipeline
The model follows a structured pipeline for efficient training and prediction:

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
✔ Standard Scaling for numerical features
✔ One-Hot Encoding for categorical features

2️⃣ Model Training
✔ Uses Multiple Linear Regression to learn complex relationships

3️⃣ Model Evaluation
✔ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
✔ Mean Squared Error (MSE) & RMSE
✔ R² Score (Explains variance in price prediction)

📊 Model Performance
The trained model's accuracy is evaluated using key metrics:

Metric	Value
📉 Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 273959.16
📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE): 94613581122.48
📉 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 307593.21
📈 R² Score: -0.0633

💡 Future Enhancements
✅ Use real-world real estate data for improved predictions
✅ Add feature selection to eliminate unnecessary variables
✅ Experiment with advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

📌 Why This Project?
This project demonstrates my ability to:
✅ Build an ML Pipeline with feature transformation
✅ Apply Multiple Linear Regression for price prediction
✅ Handle categorical & numerical data preprocessing
